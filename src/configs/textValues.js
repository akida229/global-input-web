After remembering our passwords, our mobile will type the user name and password for us, so we can use really long and complex passwords! We can login very quickly just by pointing the mobile camera to the QR code regardless of how the password is!  You can have a look at [one of our business software products](https://mediaapp.boxplus.com/) as well, If you are still not convinced, imagine you are working on a shared company computer and you need to login into many applications and each have different passwords! And make it worse, imagine you have to access the services on your company's shared computers and somebody may be watching over your shoulders while you are typing your password! All can be resolved with the Global Input mobile app solution.",
        "You may think what will happen if you loose your mobile. You can print out passwords on papers and only your mobile can decrypt it and display it on your mobile screen! And then you can print out your master encryption key and lock it in your safebox out of reach anybody. When you have a new phone, install the Global Input App on your new phone and point the mobile camera to the master QR code and your phone will recognize it automatically and impport it into your phone. This will pair your new phone with your old phone!",

Consequently, it will present you with a list of data items in the app that matches the data type. After you have selected one of these items, the service form will be filled with the data that you have selected. For example, one of the data items is to allow you to print the encrypted password on paper. In this case, the password encryption key is generated on the first use and will stay inside the app and won't be transmitted over the network. Therefore, only the phone that encrypts the password can decrypt it back. When the app identifies a password via the phone camera, it immediately decrypts it and displays it on the screen."
