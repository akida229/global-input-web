Consequently, it will present you with a list of data items in the app that matches the data type. After you have selected one of these items, the service form will be filled with the data that you have selected. For example, one of the data items is to allow you to print the encrypted password on paper. In this case, the password encryption key is generated on the first use and will stay inside the app and won't be transmitted over the network. Therefore, only the phone that encrypts the password can decrypt it back. When the app identifies a password via the phone camera, it immediately decrypts it and displays it on the screen."
