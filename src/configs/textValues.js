We are using our Global Input App to [sign into our websites](https://iterativesolution.co.uk/wp-admin/), which is powered by the Wordpress.

We don't have any more hesitation or embarrassment when we need to sign into the services via the big screen devices while everybody watching. And now you can do the same. In your workplace, you may often have to work on a shared computer and you need to login into many applications and each have different passwords. And for the security reasons, each service application should have different and long passwords, and you need to sign in very quickly. All can be now resolved with the Global Input mobile app solution.",

And then you can print out your master encryption key and lock it in your safebox out of reach anybody. When you have a new phone, install the Global Input App on your new phone and point the mobile camera to the master QR code and your phone will recognize it automatically and import it into your phone. This will pair your new phone with your old phone!",
