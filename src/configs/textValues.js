So it will present you with a list of data items in the app that matches the data type. After you have selected one of the items, the service form will be filled with the data that you have selected. For example, one of the data item is allow you to print the encrypted password on paper.  The password encryption key is generated on the first use and stay inside the app and will not be transmitted over the network. So only the phone that encrypts the password can decrypt it back.
