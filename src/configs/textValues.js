And none of us have to remember the long passwords anymore. We don't have such hesitation or embarrassment when we need to sign into the services via the big screen devices while everybody else in the room is watching. And now you can do the same. In your workplace, you may often have to work on a shared computer and you need to login into many applications and each have different passwords. For security purposes, each service application should have different and long password, and you need to sign in very quickly. All can be now solved with the Global Input mobile app solution.",
        "You may think what will happen if you lose your mobile. You can print out passwords on papers and only your mobile can decrypt it and display it on your mobile screen! And then you can print out your master encryption key and lock it in your safebox. When you have a new phone, install the Global Input App on your new phone and point the mobile camera to the master QR code and your phone will recognize it automatically and import it into your phone. This will pair your new phone with your old phone!",
